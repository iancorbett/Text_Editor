Description:

This is an application that I have built in order to have a convenient note taking app. This apphas a very simple user interface, containing just one blank text file. When the file is edited, it will automatically save your changes.

User instructions:

In order to use the application, you will need only to click on the render link, which will take you to the deployed application. Here you will be able to type into the note and it will save yoiur progress until you revisit it. Additionally, you can get the desktop icon on your desktop, and if you open the application that way, it will show you your saved note.

For this project, there was starter code that was given to me, for me to add on to in order to make the application functional. This code included all of the HTML as well all of the CSS. My changes were primarily made in the webpack file as well as the install and database javascript files. Additionally, I had help from a tutor named Joem. I was having one major issue, which was that the notes were not saving properly. The notes would be saved in the local stroage, but would not appear when the application was reloaded. Since there is only supposed to be one note saved, this was a significant bug. However, Joem was able to help me make it so that only one note is saved, and it is shown whenever the application is loaded. Other than this, I luckily did not run into any other major errors or bugs.
